# Bluetooth Joystick Controller

This repository contains the code for a Bluetooth joystick controller. The code reads joystick input data and converts it into directional commands for various movement types, such as differential drive movements. This enables precise control of robots or other devices using a Bluetooth-connected joystick.

## Overview

The Bluetooth Joystick Controller code facilitates the use of a joystick to control the movement of devices via Bluetooth. It processes the input from the joystick and translates it into specific directional commands, supporting different movement algorithms like differential drive, and transmits these commands via Bluetooth.

## Features

- **Joystick Input Processing**: Reads and processes input data from the joystick.
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Establishes and manages a Bluetooth connection to send commands.
- **Bluetooth Transmission**: Transmits directional commands via Bluetooth to the target device.
- **Movement Types**: Supports various movement algorithms, including differential drive.
- **Real-Time Control**: Provides real-time response to joystick inputs for smooth control.

## Contents

This repository includes:

- **Joystick Input Handling**: Functions to read and interpret data from the joystick.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Code to establish and maintain a Bluetooth connection with the target device.
- **Bluetooth Transmission**: Code to transmit directional commands via Bluetooth.
- **Movement Algorithms**: Implementations of different movement types, such as differential drive.
- **Example Code**: Sample scripts demonstrating how to use the joystick controller with different devices.

## Programming Languages

The code in this repository is primarily written in:

- Python
- C++

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure your device is equipped with Bluetooth capabilities and is paired with the joystick.
2. **Configuration**: Modify the configuration files to match your device's specifications.
3. **Run**: Execute the provided scripts to start receiving joystick input and controlling your device via Bluetooth.
